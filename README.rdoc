This is a two-day coding exercise I was given for a prospective employer. The task was to write a system to model libraries and books.
The instructions were specifically to:
- Create several libraries
- Create several books
- Add different books to different libraries
- Ask a library if it has a certain book, given the book's title
- Ask a library if it has a certain book, given its ISBN number
- Ask a library if it can get a book (by title or ISBN) through interlibrary loan from any of the other libraries you created
- Ask a library what its most popular book is (where popularity is measured by the number of times a user asked for that book; different libraries should have different answers to this question)
